<a data-href="Reck" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/settlements/reck.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reck</a> itself is built into the rock cliffs of a large canyon. The rock providing a natural shield from the harsh atmosphere. A settlement supporting thousands, out in the frontier of the Expanse. Barille circles the settlement, and sees an impact crater and wreckage. It looks like the attacking frigate crashed into the settlement on the south side. Not good. Smoke is coming out of the wreckage. Barille eyes what looks like a landing port nearby. The auto-landing sequence takes over, and Barille tries to ping the transport ship. BARILLE BLACK
Hey, did you make it down here? Any injured. This is Barille. COMMS OFFICER
Reading you Barille, yeah, we’re all in one piece. That was you in the fighter right? BARILLE BLACK
Any idea who that was? COMMS OFFICER
They transmitted a pretty long message, something about the Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds? That mean anything to you? BARILLE BLACK
Nope. Never heard of them. Trouble is, the suicided into Reck, so I guess we can’t ask them. You need anything? COMMS OFFICER
Yeah, the impact shook the entire canyon and its been pretty much disaster mode down here. We’re fine, thanks anyway. So we have a name. Faction:Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds A bit of a mouthful, and clearly not the most inconspicuous bunch. <br>Barille accesses the landing bay’s UI and requisitions a repair crew.

This is the beginning of a great adventure...
Begin a SessionINT. LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT SHIP, RENTED CABIN<a data-href="Barille Black" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/characters/barille-black.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Barille Black</a> is sleeping on a stiff bed, wearing his dark blue suit, loosened at the neck. He has dark curly hair, and the stubble of a beard. Character Goal:Gain Riches, Seek Power <br>
Growing up within the domain of a founder clan, the <a data-href="Circle of the Elder Stars" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/factions/circle-of-the-elder-stars.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Circle of the Elder Stars</a>, Barille's childhood was difficult. Not being of notable bloodline meant that he was relegated to the lower ranks of the Circle's caste system. However, his ability to fight, endure, and complete jobs earned him a reputation that helped elevate his status. Working jobs meant that he was able to grow his reputation, which provided access to bigger and better jobs. Barille has since left the Circle, for reasons unknown, and is currently adrift in the sector <a data-href="Devil's Chain" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/sectors/devil's-chain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Devil's Chain</a>, moving from job to job. <br>
When Barille left the Circle he made a vow, to <a data-href="Establish a new noble house in the Circle of the Elder Stars" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/progress/barille/establish-a-new-noble-house-in-the-circle-of-the-elder-stars.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Establish a new noble house in the Circle of the Elder Stars</a>. A house that would surpass all others and become the dominant authority within the faction. <br>
Barille is on a transport ship. Not having an FTL capable ship of his own, he has to buy or barter his way to systems or sectors. He is already on a job, a posted job for the <a data-href="Risen Union" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/factions/risen-union.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Risen Union</a> (RU). The RU has a reputation of keeping its cards close to the vest, but the jobs pay well, even if they tend to come with little information and lead to more questions than answers. Barille has sworn a vow for this job, to Investigate and report on the rumored horrors of Reck and he means to see it through. Barille is suddenly thrown out of his rented bed aboard the transport ship as the ship rocks violently. Either it is under attack or something catastrophic has happened. The damage is significant.BARILLE
Good gods. I’m trying to get some sleep TODAY! He stumbles to his feat, pushes buttons on the nearby panel trying to access the ship’s systems. Gather Information(Wits); 4 vs 5|3 Barille opens crew door to see klaxons flashing, people shouting down the call. He sees a crewman running by.BARILLE
Hey, what's going on? CREWMAN
We're under attack, someone's shooting! Yeah, this is not ideal. This is a transport, not a warship. Not wanting to be boarded, or explode.... Barille reaches into his pocket and flips a black iron coin. He catches it, and eyes the crewman.BARILLE
Get a message to your captain to burn like hell. I'll see if I can hold them off. NOW GO!
Okay - not sure who these hostiles are, nor why they’d be going after us? Straight up piracy? Going to need to deal with the immediate, and very explody, problem - and then figure out who is actually attacking transport ships out here. Barille pulls up the UI from his hand terminal, and initiates the pre-launch sequence for his snub fighter. Green check marks. Great, let’s get there. Barille takes off to the hanger bay. Does he get there without issue? 50/50:Yes The ship rocks a bit, sounds like the transport pilot is making moves, but no major new strikes. Barille jumps into the 27 (SN-27 snub fighter), the engines are already humming. He punches the launch control and blasts out into the void.Enter the Fray(Snub Fighter / Integrity); 9 vs 10|3 Fend off attackers until the transport can escape Position:In control With a roll of the controls, Barille immediately sees the hostiles. Looks like a large frigate with at least 3 fighters circling. The transport ship is putting on a significant burn, and there are no other friendlies. Not great odds, but Barille might be able to catch them by surprise. BARILLE
Let’s see how good their scans are. Barille shields the engines, blocks EM, and goes ballistic with a burst of RCS to set up an ambush for the returning fighters. Gain Ground(Shadow); 6 vs 3|4 They have no idea. This seems like a small time raid, and under normal circumstances, it would have been successful. Not today fellas. Barille fires the 27's railguns at the lead ship, his engine, and ship coming alive simultaneously. Strike(Edge); 🔥7 vs 9|6 Position:In a bad spot The first ship erupts, and before the others can react, Barille's fires again hitting the second target. These guys definitely didn't see him, but now they do. Barille can’t quite get a shot on the third, which starts burning away.... And then the frigate starts firing. Alarms are going off, missiles inbound, and this thing seems to have lots of guns. Barille burns and rolls the ship to evade.BARILLE BLACK
ahhhhHHHHHHH! React Under Fire(Edge); 4 vs 9|5 Barille dodges the ballistic rounds, but there's no answer for the missiles. Barille is burning hard, but one catches him and detonates. Snub Fighter / Integrity 4→2 Withstand Damage(Snub Fighter / Integrity); 6 vs 4|2 Momentum 2→3 Position:In control The hit is brutal, engine and navigation damage, but still flying. We're still being shot at, but the burn has put some distance between Barille and the attackers. <br>Really needing to stay away from that frigate. A check of on the transport ship, and yup, they are making atmo at <a data-href="Ackriss-2" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/planets/ackriss-2.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ackriss-2</a>. If Barille leaves the fight now, they'll likely just pursue the transport ship to the surface. They didn't see me before, let's try that trick again. Cutting engines, and turning up EM damping. Let's disappear and see what they do. Gain Ground(Shadow); 5 vs 1|2 Momentum 3→5 Fend off attackers until the transport can escape +1 (8/10) It is quiet for 30 seconds and they have no idea.BARILLE BLACK
Is this really going to work again? Hahaha, suckers. I guess they're not used to anyone fighting back. Let's put a round in your drive cone. Fend off attackers until the transport can escape; 8 vs 2|10 Take Decisive Action:It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective is revealed After another 30 seconds, the frigate starts to burn towards the planet. As they pivot, Barille lines up the shot and fires. A direct hit, and they are out of commission... except they aren't? Action + Theme:Create World Their ship should be out of commission, but somehow it is still accelerating? The third fighter is nowhere on scans and something is very wrong. <br>The frigate's engines aren't lit, no heat signatures, yet it is still actively pursuing the transport ship, which is headed directly to <a data-href="Reck" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/settlements/reck.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reck</a>. The 27's engines come alive, and then sputter, Barille isn't going to be able to catch them limping along. A bit of time passes and the frigate should have started their retro burn by now, they are going way to fast for reentry. It's beyond visual range, but sensors are still showing the frigate accelerate towards the planet. BARILLE BLACK
Oh no. They... they wouldn't. WHAT?!
The frigate enters atmosphere. Starts breaking apart. Whatever is left of it is going to collide with Reck and destroy a significant part of the settlement. Barille is out of range to do anything but watch.
What is going on here? That shot in their drive cone should have put any ship out of commission. And not even that, they were accelerating for a suicide strike? How does that make sense for a low-level raid? BARILLE BLACK
Okay, let's get down there and see if we can help. Hopefully the settlement had some form of defense, otherwise the destruction is going to be.... Let's just get down there.

A framework for collaborative, asynchronous storytelling in The Foundry
I've always wanted to try asynchronous Ironsworn, and Epistolary games have also always fascinated me. This, TOTALLY optional, framework for playing an Epistolary version of Ironsworn, Starforged, or Sundered Isles. You most certainly can ignore this and just create your own campaign (or go play in someone else's), but it is here if you are interested.Epistolary play is a style of collaborative storytelling where multiple players contribute to a shared narrative through letters, messages, or journal entries written in-character. Each player plays their own game, pursues their own adventures, but periodically writes a Spotlight Letter, a meaningful contribution to the shared story that connects to a Shared Vow spanning the entire campaign.This format works beautifully with The Foundry's ownership model: you own your letters, others own theirs, and the shared narrative grows organically through addition.This guide covers:
For Players - How to join and play in an Epistolary campaign
For Organizers - How to set up and run an Epistolary campaign Play your game. Run your character through adventures, vows, and encounters as you normally would.
Write a Spotlight Letter. When you have something meaningful to share — a milestone on the Shared Vow or a narrative moment worth telling — write an in-character letter describing what happened.
Mark progress (if applicable). If your letter represents a milestone, the Organizer marks progress on the Shared Vow.
Wait your turn. You can't write two Spotlight Letters in a row — someone else must write before you can contribute again.
Repeat. Keep playing, keep writing, watch the shared story unfold.
Every Epistolary campaign has a Shared Vow, a significant goal that multiple characters across multiple locations are working toward. This vow responds to The Trouble, a threat or situation affecting the entire region.The Shared Vow exists to connect many independent stories together, it is not the only thing you should pursue. You are encouraged to swear personal vows and chase them alongside the shared one. Your character's own goals, relationships, and adventures are the heart of your game. The Shared Vow is the thread that weaves everyone's stories into something larger.The Shared Vow is owned by the Organizer, who tracks progress based on player letters. You can't edit the vow file directly (The Foundry prevents that), but your letters drive its progress.Example Troubles and Shared Vows: Trouble: A tyrannical faction is consolidating power across the sector Shared Vow: "Expose their atrocities and rally resistance" (Extreme) Trouble: Ancient horrors are awakening across the Ironlands Shared Vow: "Discover the source and find a way to stop them" (Extreme) Trouble: A cursed fleet is preying on trade routes throughout the isles Shared Vow: "Hunt down the fleet and end their reign of terror" (Extreme) Create your character. Use Iron Vault to create a new character in the campaign. Build them however you like. The Organizer may have setting guidance, but your character is yours.
Subscribe to the Shared Vow. Find the Shared Vow in the campaign and incorporate it into your new character. The shared vow should have meaning to your character and help drive their actions.
Start playing. Run your character through adventures, pursue personal vows, and engage with the world.
Write your first Spotlight Letter. When you have something to share, a milestone on the Shared Vow or a narrative moment worth telling, write a letter and drop it in the Epistolary folder.
That's it. You're in.Your Spotlight Letters are written in-character. They might be:
An actual letter to another character or faction
A journal entry or captain's log
A report to a contact or superior
A message left at a dead drop
A recording transmitted across the void
What to include:
What happened, the events, encounters, and outcomes
How it connects to The Trouble and the Shared Vow
What you don't need:
A specific format, write however fits your character
Mechanical details, focus on the narrative, not the dice
Some Spotlight Letters mark progress on the Shared Vow (when you've reached a milestone); others enrich the story without advancing the track. Both matter. Both count.The core constraint:
You cannot write two Spotlight Letters in a row. After you post a letter, wait until another player posts one before writing again.
This ensures everyone gets their turn in the spotlight and prevents any single player from dominating the shared narrative, whether through progress or pure storytelling. It's not a strict turn order, it's a rhythm of shared writing.When does a letter mark progress? When you've reached a milestone on the Shared Vow, use the Reach a Milestone move as your guide. Progress represents meaningful change, not just effort.You can still:
Play your own game as much as you want
Pursue your own side quests, personal vows, and adventures
Epistolary play runs on trust. While The Foundry's ownership system prevents you from editing other players' files, you can still write whatever you want in your own letters. This is where "Yes, and..." becomes essential.What this means for your letters:
Don't narratively destroy what others create. Avoid writing that another player's character died, their ship was destroyed, or their faction was wiped out. Their creations are theirs to conclude.
Build on, don't bulldoze. Reference others' content as inspiration, not as targets. Add to the shared story rather than subtracting from it.
Treat others' creations as living stories. That character, location, or contact might still be in active play. Write as if the original creator might continue their story tomorrow.
When in doubt, go adjacent. Instead of writing definitive outcomes for others' content, write about rumors, near-misses, or your character's perception of events.
Good: "I heard the Crimson Tide was spotted near the ghost fleet's hunting grounds. Captain Vance is either brave or foolish."Bad: "The Crimson Tide was destroyed by the ghost fleet. Captain Vance went down with her ship."The first leaves threads for others to pick up. The second closes doors that aren't yours to close.When the Shared Vow's progress track is completely full, the Organizer will make the Fulfill Your Vow move. After that:
Each player gets to write one final letter wrapping up their character's contribution to the story
The Organizer then writes a closing narrative
The requirement that the track be full (rather than just having enough progress to attempt the move) ensures everyone knows when the endgame is approaching and can prepare their final contributions.Letters are typically stored in Lore/Epistolary/ within the campaign folder. Check with your Organizer for the specific location.The Shared Vow file will usually be in the campaign's Progress folder, owned by the Organizer.As the Organizer, you're creating the stage for collaborative play:
The Campaign - The world, setting, and context
The Trouble - The threat that spans your region
The Shared Vow - The goal players are working toward
The Infrastructure - Folders, files, and documentation
You don't control the story - you facilitate it. Players drive the narrative through their letters; you track progress and maintain the shared elements.Use Iron Vault to create a new campaign in your folder. Set up:
Your campaign file with truths/setting details
Your region (sector, ironlands area, archipelago, etc.)
Any starting locations, factions, or context you want to establish
System-specific scope suggestions:
Starforged: A sector works well as the natural boundary
Ironsworn: A region of the Ironlands, or a specific area with defined borders
Sundered Isles: An archipelago, trade route, or stretch of the Cursed Seas
But don't over-prepare, leave room for players to create their own locations within your region.The Trouble is the inciting threat that the Shared Vow responds to. It should be:
Broad enough that multiple characters in different locations can encounter it
Significant enough to warrant a major vow
Open-ended enough that players can engage with it in different ways
Good Troubles affect the whole region. They might be:
A faction expanding aggressively
A supernatural phenomenon spreading
A resource becoming scarce or contested
An ancient threat awakening
A plague, curse, or corruption taking hold
Avoid Troubles that are too localized (a monster in one cave) or too personal (one character's nemesis).Create a vow file in your campaign's Progress folder. This is the mechanical heart of the Epistolary game.Choosing a rank: The vow's rank determines the minimum number of progress-marking letters needed to fill the track:
Troublesome: 4 letters
Dangerous: 5 letters
Formidable: 10 letters
Extreme: 20 letters
Epic: 40 letters
Extreme works well for most Epistolary campaigns, long enough to feel significant, short enough to actually complete. Go Formidable for a shorter arc with fewer players, or Epic if you want a truly long-running saga.The vow should:
Directly respond to The Trouble
Be achievable through varied approaches (combat, diplomacy, investigation, etc.)
Allow for partial successes and setbacks along the way
You own this file. Other players can't edit it (The Foundry enforces this). You'll update progress based on their letters.Create Lore/Epistolary/ (or your preferred location) in your campaign folder. This is where players will drop their letters.Consider creating:
A brief README or index file explaining the campaign's Trouble and Shared Vow
A link to this guide
The Letter Template (optional)
Write a campaign introduction that includes:
The setting and region
The Trouble (what's wrong)
The Shared Vow (what players are working toward)
How to join (create a character, start playing, write letters)
Any specific guidelines for your campaign
Your ongoing responsibilities:
Monitor letters - Read new letters as they come in
Track progress - Update the Shared Vow when letters mark progress (milestones)
Maintain context - Keep the campaign docs updated if needed
Facilitate the endgame - When the track is full, make the Fulfill Your Vow move and invite final letters
You don't need to:
Approve letters before they're posted
Coordinate player schedules
Write letters yourself (though you can if you have a character)
Resolve conflicts between player narratives (The Foundry's ownership model handles this)

This template is optional. Write however fits your character.
# [Title or Subject] **From:** [Your character] **To:** [Recipient, if applicable] **Date:** [In-world date, if you track it] --- [Your letter content here. Write in-character. Describe what happened, what you learned, what you did. Let your character's voice come through.] --- **Progress:** [Yes/No — Use the *Reach a Milestone* move as your guide.]
# Transmission from the Outer Reach **From:** Captain Vex Morrow, *The Silent Drift* **To:** Anyone still listening **Date:** Cycle 47, Day 12 --- We found another dead station today. Third one this month. The Risen Union's banners were still hanging in the command center, but the people were gone. All of them. No signs of struggle, no damage to the hull. Just... empty. Like they walked out an airlock and never came back. I pulled the station logs before we left. Most of it was corrupted, but I recovered fragments. They mention "the signal" — same thing the miners on Ackriss-2 were talking about before they went dark. I'm transmitting everything I found to the Circle's relay network. If anyone else is tracking this, maybe together we can figure out what the Union is really doing out here. Morrow out. --- **Progress:** *Yes — Recovered critical data about the Union's activities.*
# Scratched into bark, left at the Oldstone crossing **From:** Kira of the Ash Valley **Date:** Three days past the autumn moon --- To whoever finds this — The blight has reached the eastern woods. I saw it myself. Trees blackened from the inside, animals fleeing west in numbers I've never seen. The hunters from Thornwall say it started near the old barrow, the one the elders forbade us from entering. I went anyway. The door was open. Something had broken out, not in. The iron chains that once held it shut were shattered — not rusted, not worn. Shattered. Whatever was bound there is loose now. I'm heading to the Havens to warn them. If you're reading this, don't go east. And if you know anything about what was buried in that barrow, find me. We need answers. — Kira --- **Progress:** *Yes — Discovered the source of the blight.*
# Captain's Log — The Crimson Tide **From:** Captain Isabela Vance **Date:** Seventeenth day out of Port Sorrow --- The ghost fleet struck again last night. We spotted their lanterns through the fog — green fire, like always — and ran dark. Cut the engines, doused every light, and drifted. For three hours we listened to them pass, close enough to hear their rigging creak. They took the *Merchant's Promise* instead. We watched from the dark as they boarded her. No cannon fire. No screams. The crew just... stopped moving. Then the ghost ships swallowed her whole and vanished back into the fog. I marked their heading before they disappeared. They're not raiding at random — they're following the old trade currents, the ones that dried up a century ago. Someone on this crew knows those charts. We found where they anchor. A hidden cove on the far side of the Shattered Reef, masked by the fog they seem to command. We're going back with allies. — Vance --- **Progress:** *Yes — Located the ghost fleet's anchorage.* Voice matters more than format. A gruff mercenary writes differently than a scholarly mystic. Let your character come through.
Show, don't tell. Describe what happened, what you saw, what you felt. The narrative is more engaging than a summary.
Connect to The Trouble and Shared Vow. Your letter should relate to the shared threat.
Leave threads for others. Mention rumors, sightings, or questions that other players might pick up.
"Yes, and..." always. Reference others' content as inspiration, not targets. Don't write definitive fates for characters, ships, or places that aren't yours.

Drop your Spotlight Letters into this folder to contribute to the shared story.
A notorious pirate clan has emerged in Devil's Chain, striking with unnatural precision and wielding powers that defy explanation. Settlements like Reck lie in ruins, plagued by terrifying manifestations in the pirates' wake. Rumors speak of Remnant technology, ghost light rituals, or something worse. Whatever the source of their power, it's spreading — and it may already be beyond their control.<a data-href="Expose the darkness behind the attacks across the sector and stop it from spreading" href="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/progress/expose-the-darkness-behind-the-attacks-across-the-sector-and-stop-it-from-spreading.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Expose the darkness behind the attacks across the sector and stop it from spreading</a>
Play your game — run your character through adventures in Devil's Chain
When you have something meaningful to share — a milestone or a narrative moment worth telling — write a Spotlight Letter
Drop it in this folder
If your letter represents a milestone, the Organizer marks progress on the Shared Vow
The Spotlight Rule: You can't write two Spotlight Letters in a row. Wait for another player to post before writing again.Your Spotlight Letter can be anything in-character:
An actual letter to someone
A journal entry or captain's log
A report to a contact
A recording transmitted across the void

Iron Vault helps by providing a folder scaffold, but you can create files and folders anywhere in the repository - there are no path restrictions. Feel free to organize your content however makes sense for your story.Join existing campaigns! The Foundry shines when players contribute to each other's worlds:
Create your character in someone else's campaign folder
Write journal entries from your character's perspective
Add locations, NPCs, or other content that enriches the shared world
Remember: you can only edit files you create, but you can read everything
Example: If you want to join "The Starforged" campaign, create The Starforged/Characters/YourCharacter.md and start playing. The campaign creator can read your content but can't edit it, and vice versa.Practice "Yes, and..." in your writing. The Foundry protects files technically, but collaborative storytelling requires narrative respect too:
Write about others' creations as living, ongoing stories - not concluded ones
Use rumors, observations, and your character's perspective rather than definitive statements about others' content
If your story needs something dramatic to happen to shared content, reach out to the creator first
Remember: your files are yours, other's files are theirs, but the universe is everyone's Use descriptive folder and file names
Avoid special characters that might cause issues across platforms
Hyphens or underscaces work great (e.g., My-Character.md or My_Character.md)
Spaces are fine too, but some players prefer hyphens for consistency
Beyond the required plugins (Iron Vault and FIT), consider installing these optional plugins to enhance your experience:Required:
Iron Vault - For playing Ironsworn, Starforged, or Sundered Isles (you need this!)
FIT - For syncing with GitHub (you need this too!)
Optional but useful:
Dataview - Create fancy character sheets and dynamic queries
Excalidraw - Draw maps, diagrams, and visual content
Use "remind" mode for the safest experience. FIT can sync automatically, but there's a catch: if you're actively writing when a sync triggers, you might get a conflict. This happens because FIT reads your files, syncs them, then updates its cache - but if you edited a file during that 1-2 second window, the timing can get confused.Recommended FIT settings for writers:
Set Auto sync to Remind instead of On
Set Check every X minutes to 5-10 minutes
When you see "Remote update detected", finish your current thought, then click the GitHub icon to sync manually
This way you're always in control of when syncs happen, and you won't lose work mid-sentence.If you prefer auto-sync anyway:
Watch for the spinning GitHub icon - that means a sync is running
If you do get a conflict, don't panic - your local work is always preserved
Understanding the _fit/ folder: When FIT detects a conflict (same file changed both locally and remotely), it saves the remote version to _fit/your-file.md and keeps your local version in place. You can then manually compare and merge if needed. Feel free to delete files from _fit/ once you've resolved them.If your edits disappear: This means you tried to edit a file you don't own. The Foundry automatically restored it. Create your own file instead!

Can I rename or move my files?
Yes! You own your files, so you can rename, move, or delete them freely.Can I delete someone else's file?
No. The Foundry will automatically restore it.What if I accidentally edit someone else's file?
No worries! The Foundry will silently restore it on the next sync. No harm done.Can multiple people edit the same file?
No. Each file has exactly one owner. For collaborative content, create separate files that reference each other.How do I know who owns a file?<br>
If you created the file, you own it. If you didn't create it, you don't.

Playing in The Foundry? You can stop here — everything above is all you need. The rest is for contributors and those curious about how the system works.<br>For full technical details, see <a class="internal-link" data-href=".foundry/SPECIFICATION.md" href=".html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SPECIFICATION.md</a>, which covers:
Ownership model and registry system
Enforcement pipeline
Guardian protection system
Edge cases and implementation details Version Control: Git/GitHub
Automation: GitHub Actions (enforcement pipeline + external Guardian)
Ownership Registry: Centralized YAML with SHA-256 checksums
Sync Tool: FIT plugin for Obsidian
Game System: Iron Vault plugin for Obsidian
The Foundry uses a two-tier protection system:
Enforcement Pipeline — Runs on every push, validates ownership, reverts unauthorized edits
<br>External Guardian — Runs every 15 minutes from a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/nickarrow/the-foundry-guardian" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/nickarrow/the-foundry-guardian" target="_self">separate private repository</a>, protecting the enforcement infrastructure itself
Even if an attacker deletes all workflows, the Guardian restores everything within 15 minutes. Maximum vulnerability window: 15 minutes.Want to improve The Foundry itself (not just add campaign content)?

Hateful ideologies are not tolerated. This includes but is not limited to hate speech based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or any other attacks on one's personhood.2. Be kind. Discuss, don't argue. Respect the input of others. Everyone's contributions, experiences, and approaches are valued (though see rule #1). Threatening behavior, abuse, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated.3. Keep it clean. Avoid NSFW content. When in doubt, mark it as NSFW or use content warnings.4. Support creators. Do not upload commercial PDFs or links to pirated materials, and do not discuss pirated content.5. Be respectful. This is a shared creative space.6. The "Yes, and..." Philosophy The Foundry embraces the improv principle of building on others' contributions rather than negating them.While The Foundry's technical systems prevent you from editing or deleting other players' files, you can still write whatever you want in your own files. This is where "Yes, and..." becomes a social contract:What this means in practice:
Don't narratively destroy what others create. Even in your own journals, avoid writing that another player's character died, their settlement was obliterated, or their faction was wiped out. Their creations are theirs to conclude.
Build on, don't bulldoze. Reference others' content as inspiration, not as targets. Add to the universe rather than subtracting from it.
Treat others' creations as living stories. That character, location, or faction might still be in active play. Write as if the original creator might continue their story tomorrow.
When in doubt, go adjacent. Instead of writing definitive outcomes for others' content, write about rumors, near-misses, or your character's perception of events.
The real magic of The Foundry happens when players contribute to each other's worlds:
Browse existing campaigns — Find a world that interests you
Create your character there — Add your hero to their folder
Write your own journals — Your perspective on their world
Watch it grow — Both of you see the shared universe expand
You own your files. They own theirs. Neither can edit the other's work. The world grows organically through addition, not modification.<br>Contact <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/nickarrow" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/nickarrow" target="_self">@nickarrow</a> or join the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://discord.gg/8bRuZwK" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://discord.gg/8bRuZwK" target="_self">Ironsworn Discord</a>.<br>Ready to set up?

Over millennia, we consumed resources and shattered lives as we fueled the engines of industry, expansion, and war. In the end, a powerful foe took advantage of our rivalries in a violent bid for power. Fleeing the devastation, we assembled our fleets and traveled to the Forge. A new home. A fresh start. In this final war, we were set upon by: A tyrannical faction or leader
When the Exodus fleet set off on a ponderous journey to a new home outside our galaxy, they marked the Forge as their destination. Countless generations lived out their lives aboard those titanic ships during the millennia-long passage. The refugees built a rich legacy of culture and tradition during the Exodus. Some even remained in the ships after their arrival in the Forge, unwilling or unable to leave their familiar confines. Those vessels, the Ironhomes, still sail the depths of this galaxy.
Dangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans. We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and territorial skirmishes are common.
Iron vows are sworn upon totems crafted from the enigmatic metal we call black iron. Black iron was first forged by a long-dead civilization. Some say it is a living metal, attuned to the hidden depths of the universe. Remnants of this prized resource are found within ancient sites throughout the Forge. It is resistant to damage and corrosion, but can be molded using superheated plasma at specialized facilities. The Ironsworn carry weapons, armor, or tokens crafted from black iron, and swear vows upon it.
Much of the settled domains are a lawless frontier. Criminal factions and corrupt leaders often hold sway. Powers rise and fall in the Forge, so any authority is fleeting. In the end, we must fend for ourselves. A few communities are bastions of successful autonomy, but many are corrupted or preyed upon by petty despots, criminals, and raiders.
Our faith is as diverse as our people. Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.
Unnatural energies flow through the Forge. Magic and science are two sides of the same coin. Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the Forge's energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure.
Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements. Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.
To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements. Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and powerful. For most, advanced medical care is out of reach. When someone suffers a grievous injury, they'll often turn to a rigger for a makeshift mechanical solution.
Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge. Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge.
War never ends. Talented weaponsmiths and shipwrights craft deadly, high-tech tools of destruction. Dominant factions wield mighty fleets and battle-hardened troops. Those in power have access to weapons of horrific destructive potential. Skirmishes and wars flare across the settled domains, and most are pawns or casualties in these destructive campaigns.
This is a perilous and often inhospitable galaxy, but life finds a way. Life in the Forge is diverse. Planets are often home to a vast array of creatures, and our starships cruise with spaceborne lifeforms riding their wake. Even animals from our homeworld—carried aboard the Exodus ships—have adapted to live with us in the Forge.
The biomechanical lifeforms we call the Remnants, engineered by civilizations as weapons in a cataclysmic war, survived the death of their creators. On scarred planets and within precursor vaults throughout the Forge, the Remnants still guard ancient secrets and fight unending wars.
Most insist that horrors aren’t real. Spacers know the truth. When you travel the depths of the Forge, be wary. Some say we are cursed by those who did not survive the cataclysm, and the veil between life and death is forever weakened. Supernatural occurrences and entities are especially common near a white dwarf star. These stellar objects, which spacers call ghost lights, are the decaying remnants of a dead star. ]]></description><link>the-starforged-(nickarrow)/truths.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Starforged (NickArrow)/Truths.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 18:59:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[acyrus-system]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/sectors/attachments/acyrus-system.svg" target="_self">]]></description><link>the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/sectors/attachments/acyrus-system.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Starforged (NickArrow)/Locations/Sectors/attachments/acyrus-system.svg</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 02:31:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[acyrus]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/planets/attachments/acyrus.gif" target="_self">]]></description><link>the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/planets/attachments/acyrus.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Starforged (NickArrow)/Locations/Planets/attachments/acyrus.gif</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 02:27:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[devils-chain-background]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/sectors/attachments/devils-chain-background.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>the-starforged-(nickarrow)/locations/sectors/attachments/devils-chain-background.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Starforged (NickArrow)/Locations/Sectors/attachments/devils-chain-background.png</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 02:21:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[barille black profile]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="the-starforged-(nickarrow)/characters/attachments/barille-black-profile.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>the-starforged-(nickarrow)/characters/attachments/barille-black-profile.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Starforged (NickArrow)/Characters/attachments/barille black profile.png</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 05:05:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Risen Union]]></title><link>the-starforged-(nickarrow)/factions/risen-union.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Starforged (NickArrow)/Factions/Risen Union.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 19:32:13 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
