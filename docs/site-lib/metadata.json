The rock providing a natural shield from the harsh atmosphere. A settlement supporting thousands, out in the frontier of the Expanse. Barille circles the settlement, and sees an impact crater and wreckage. It looks like the attacking frigate crashed into the settlement on the south side. Not good. Smoke is coming out of the wreckage. Barille eyes what looks like a landing port nearby. The auto-landing sequence takes over, and Barille tries to ping the transport ship. BARILLE BLACK\nHey, did you make it down here? Any injured. This is Barille. COMMS OFFICER\nReading you Barille, yeah, we’re all in one piece. That was you in the fighter right? BARILLE BLACK\nAny idea who that was? COMMS OFFICER\nThey transmitted a pretty long message, something about the Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds? That mean anything to you? BARILLE BLACK\nNope. Never heard of them. Trouble is, the suicided into Reck, so I guess we can’t ask them. You need anything? COMMS OFFICER\nYeah, the impact shook the entire canyon and its been pretty much disaster mode down here. We’re fine, thanks anyway. So we have a name. Faction:Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds A bit of a mouthful, and clearly not the most inconspicuous bunch. <br>Barille accesses the landing bay’s UI and requisitions a repair crew.
